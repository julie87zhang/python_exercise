    "Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some advantages of decision trees are:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simple to understand and to interpret. Trees can be visualised.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Requires little data preparation. Other techniques often require data normalisation, dummy variables need to be created and blank values to be removed. Note however that this module does not support missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Able to handle both numerical and categorical data. However scikit-learn implementation does not support categorical variables for now. Other techniques are usually specialised in analysing datasets that have only one type of variable. See algorithms for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Able to handle multi-output problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses a white box model. If a given situation is observable in a model, the explanation for the condition is easily explained by boolean logic. By contrast, in a black box model (e.g., in an artificial neural network), results may be more difficult to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Possible to validate a model using statistical tests. That makes it possible to account for the reliability of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Performs well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the true model from which the data were generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The disadvantages of decision trees include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalise the data well. This is called overfitting. Mechanisms such as pruning, setting the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree are necessary to avoid this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Predictions of decision trees are neither smooth nor continuous, but piecewise constant approximations as seen in the above figure. Therefore, they are not good at extrapolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be NP-complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple concepts. Consequently, practical decision-tree learning algorithms are based on heuristic algorithms such as the greedy algorithm where locally optimal decisions are made at each node. Such algorithms cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. This can be mitigated by training multiple trees in an ensemble learner, where the features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree.\n",

    "## **Random forest**\n",
    "like its name implies, consists of a large number of individual decision trees that operate as an ensemble. Each individual tree in the random forest spits out a class prediction and the class with the most votes becomes our model’s prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization of a Random Forest Model Making a Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental concept behind random forest is a simple but powerful one — the wisdom of crowds. In data science speak, the reason that the random forest model works so well is:\n",
    "\n",
    "A large number of relatively uncorrelated models (trees) operating as a committee will outperform any of the individual constituent models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The low correlation between models is the key. Just like how investments with low correlations (like stocks and bonds) come together to form a portfolio that is greater than the sum of its parts, uncorrelated models can produce ensemble predictions that are more accurate than any of the individual predictions. The reason for this wonderful effect is that the trees protect each other from their individual errors (as long as they don’t constantly all err in the same direction). While some trees may be wrong, many other trees will be right, so as a group the trees are able to move in the correct direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the prerequisites for random forest to perform well are:\n",
    "There needs to be some actual signal in our features so that models built using those features do better than random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictions (and therefore the errors) made by the individual trees need to have low correlations with each other."

    "## Isolation Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "Isolation Forest is similar in principle to Random Forest and is built on the basis of decision trees. Isolation Forest, however, identifies anomalies or outliers rather than profiling normal data points. Isolation Forest isolates observations by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of that selected feature. This split depends on how long it takes to separate the points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random partitioning produces noticeably shorter paths for anomalies. When a forest of random trees collectively produces shorter path lengths for particular samples, they are highly likely to be anomalies."
